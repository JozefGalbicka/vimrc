# vimrc

Here is my simple personal Vim configuration which i use in my daily job. Repository mainly helps me track changes but is also used as source for my Ansible playbooks to build VMs. 

## Installation

Installation is pretty straightforward, vimrc file already contains code that will install `vim-plug` plugin manager and all specified plugins/themes for you, so all you have to do is move vimrc file to your home directory and launch `vim`. Make sure you have `curl` and `git` installed on your machine. Also, check requirements for [`YouCompleteMe`](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe) plugin, such as `cmake`, `python`, and `gcc`.
